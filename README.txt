# STREAMLIT UPLOAD - Pro Scanner (FIXED)

## Upload These 6 Files:

1. scanner_qullamaggie_pro.py      (FIXED - Sorting error resolved)
2. ultimate_platform_ENHANCED.py   (Line 20 uses Pro scanner)
3. config.py
4. complete_tickers.py
5. telegram_bot_fixed.py
6. requirements.txt

## What Was Fixed:
- Sorting error with rating_details dictionary
- Now sorts by stars + total_score (numeric)

## Upload to Streamlit and it will work!
